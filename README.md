# Sellular-run-script
A simple shell script to run all the required servers and open vscode, safari and Firefox windows to ease the development process.


### Note this heavily uses AppleScript to open new tabs of terminal and open Firefox, hence it can only be used on a MAC
#### The paths have been hardcoded, please change them if you plan to reuse this script
